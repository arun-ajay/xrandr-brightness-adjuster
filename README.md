# xrandr-brightness-adjuster

I wrote this pretty quickly since I was tired of manually adjusting my monitors' brightness level.
This should detect all of your monitors and adjust the brightness with whatever float value you provide. 

##### Sample Usage

Run `./brightness.sh` on the command line and supply a float value. 

```
arun@Arun:~$ ./brightness.sh 
Give a brightness that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0
0.5
```

Your monitor brightness should change accordingly. 

I plan on adding additional features in the near future -- open to ideas! :)
